# Mountain
A Small Electron Music Player I made after getting fed up with iTunes/Apple Music


## Running it
To run clone this repo and cd into it
then run
```
npm i && npm start
```
to run the program

## Playing Music
To Play Music You can download a song(.mp3, .mp4, .m4a etc...) then drop it into a folder somewhere(like ~/music) then open up mountain
and for the first field put in the FULL PATH to the file. Then if you wish to loop the song put true in the box below and the click ```Play Music```!

## Installing
If you want to have mountain installed as an app on your computer you can run the .pkg installer
from the releases page
